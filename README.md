# Homework01-CSS

To assist me with this work I googled CSS best practice and found this site and am using it as a guide: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/30-css-best-practices-for-beginners--net-6741

Also Visual code has links to the MDN site when you hover over codes and I found that really helpful.

Think about dooing this:
/*
    font-family: "Anton", cursive;
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
    Text color : #333;
    Dark blue : #345995;
    Light blue : #4392F1;
    Red : #D7263D;
    Yellow : #EAC435;
    Orange : #F46036;
*/

CHANGES MADE
Recommendation was to organise the stylesheet with a Top-Down structure - viz Generic classes: Header: Navmenu: Main content and make a comment on each section.
